## MiniGoStop – Conversation Transcript and Summary

Date: 2025-09-15

### Summary of Outcomes
- Explained how button behavior is controlled via `jsPsychHtmlButtonResponse` (`choices`, `button_html`, `response_ends_trial`, `on_finish`).
- Clarified how `index.html` (runtime, CSS, startup) and `main.js` (timeline and logic) work together.
- Refactored `main.js` to remove duplication, hoist shared logic, and use `timeline_variables` with conditional steps; introduced CSS classes for buttons.
- Moved jsPsych initialization into `main.js` and added mobile-friendly viewport; added `defer` to script tags.
- Implemented mobile tap visual feedback using a `.button--pressed` class toggled by pointer events, ensuring quick taps show pressed state.

### Key Edits Made
- `main.js`
  - Converted `var` to `const`/`let`, removed unused `toString()` and empty logs.
  - Added `onFinishTrial` and consolidated trials via `timeline_variables` with conditional steps for stop/target.
  - Initialized jsPsych in `main.js` and delayed `jsPsych.run(timeline)` until DOM ready.
  - Added delegated pointer event handlers to toggle `.button--pressed` on quick taps.
- `index.html`
  - Added `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">`.
  - Added `defer` to jsPsych and `main.js` script tags.
  - Centralized button sizing with `.button--sm`, `.button--md`, `.button--task` and added `.button--pressed`.

### Concise Transcript
1) User: What part of this code controls how the button works?
   - Assistant: Pointed to `jsPsychHtmlButtonResponse` fields in `main.js` and plugin, cited relevant lines.

2) User: How do `main.js` and `index.html` work together to control button behavior?
   - Assistant: Explained load order, CSS, plugin role, and how `jsPsych.run(timeline)` uses `main.js`.

3) User: How can I make this project more efficient?
   - Assistant: Proposed DRYing trials, using `timeline_variables`, moving inline styles to CSS, minor cleanups, and deferring scripts.

4) User: Yes, please make those suggested changes.
   - Assistant: Implemented refactor and CSS changes; added `defer`. Confirmed no linter issues.

5) User: Project should run on mobile via GitHub Pages; ensure multi-platform.
   - Assistant: Moved jsPsych init/run into `main.js`; added viewport meta; removed inline runner.

6) User: On mobile, quick taps don’t show button press visuals; long press does.
   - Assistant: Added touch-friendly CSS and delegated pointer events to toggle `.button--pressed` on `pointerdown`/`pointerup` for instant feedback.

### Files Referenced
- `index.html`
- `main.js`
- `jspsych/plugin-html-button-response.js` (library behavior)

### Notes
- Button correctness logic remains based on `data.correct_response` (targets use `0`).
- If additional mobile polish is desired (e.g., haptics), we can add optional `navigator.vibrate(10)` where supported.
